                <Text>
                    The DOLCKER & CLIP system for dolcker-type ceramic facades
                    is a system with high-inertia profiles and double security.
                    Each and every one of the elements that make up this system
                    are manufactured with the highest quality raw materials.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    It is a mechanical clip fixing system + chemical fixing by
                    means of a substructure that is made up of adjustable
                    brackets made of high-quality aluminum in the shape of an
                    “L”, 3 mm thick, which transmit forces and are fixed by
                    means of anchoring to the base structure of the building
                    (brick wall or concrete slab). On these brackets, the 3 mm
                    thick “T” shaped vertical extruded aluminum profiles are
                    fixed by means of stainless steel self-drilling screws.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Horizontal “G”-shaped profiles are screwed into these
                    “T”-shaped profiles, thus allowing the piece to be supported
                    in its entirety. It is the ideal system for placing
                    ceramics, allowing the pieces to be replaced as it has a
                    sliding stainless steel clip, achieving an infinite number
                    of placements. It also allows the horizontal profile to be
                    lacquered according to the color of its carpentry, allowing
                    the customer to choose the color of the joint. At least two
                    sliding clips are placed on top of the starter piece at 1/5
                    of the length of the piece. In the rest of the intermediate
                    pieces, at least 4 clips will be placed for each piece of
                    ceramic. Points of sika-111 polyurethane gluing and sealing
                    putty or similar (4 per piece) will be added to allow us to
                    absorb the expansion of the façade in the sliding clips.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    It is, without a doubt, a system with multiple façade
                    composition options since it is possible to break the
                    vertical joints. These vertical joints are minimized to just
                    1 mm, thus enhancing the horizontal joints. The output of
                    the ceramic is between 43-47 mm depending on the thickness
                    of the chosen ceramic.
